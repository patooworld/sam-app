sam pipeline init generates a pipeline configuration file that your CI/CD system
can use to deploy serverless applications using AWS SAM.
We will guide you through the process to bootstrap resources for each stage,
then walk through the details necessary for creating the pipeline config file.

Please ensure you are in the root folder of your SAM application before you begin.

Select a pipeline template to get started:

Checking for existing stages...

2 stage(s) were detected, matching the template requirements. If these are incorrect, delete .aws-sam/pipeline/pipelineconfig.toml and rerun

This template configures a pipeline that deploys a serverless application to a testing and a production stage.

What is the git branch used for production deployments? [main]:
What is the template file path? [template.yaml]:
We use the stage configuration name to automatically retrieve the bootstrapped resources created when you ran `sam pipeline bootstrap`.

Here are the stage configuration names detected in .aws-sam/pipeline/pipelineconfig.toml:
	1 - dev
	2 - prod
Select an index or enter the stage 1's configuration name (as provided during the bootstrapping): 1
What is the sam application stack name for stage 1? [sam-app]: the-complete-sam-workshop-github-actions-dev
Stage 1 configured successfully, configuring stage 2.

Here are the stage configuration names detected in .aws-sam/pipeline/pipelineconfig.toml:
	1 - dev
	2 - prod
Select an index or enter the stage 2's configuration name (as provided during the bootstrapping): 2
What is the sam application stack name for stage 2? [sam-app]: the-complete-sam-workshop-github-actions-prod
Stage 2 configured successfully.
